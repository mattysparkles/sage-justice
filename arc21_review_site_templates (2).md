## Template Format for Selenium Automation

Each review site will require the following configuration:

```json
{
  "site_name": "Avvo",
  "category": "Legal & Attorney Review Sites",
  "url": "https://www.avvo.com",
  "review_path": [
    {"type": "click", "selector": "button.write-review"},
    {"type": "input", "selector": "#title", "content": "{title}"},
    {"type": "input", "selector": "#review", "content": "{body}"},
    {"type": "select", "selector": "#rating", "value": "5"},
    {"type": "click", "selector": "button.submit"}
  ],
  "requires_account": true,
  "captcha_handling": "deathbycaptcha"
}
```

## Next Steps

- Prioritize legal and business platforms (high trust/SEO value).
- Auto-detect category and pull template config from local JSON.
- Build GUI interface for mapping new sites.
- Test each flow with proxy/VPN rotation enabled.
