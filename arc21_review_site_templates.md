## ü§ñ Selenium Template Strategy

Each site will receive a JSON or Python template stored in `/templates/sites/{site_name}.json` that includes:

- Input field selectors (Name, Review, Rating, etc.)
- Login flow (if required)
- Navigation mapping (URL path, click order)
- CAPTCHA workaround requirements

Templates are recorded via:
1. Manual path recording via GUI step-through (already in Phase 2)
2. Saving detected input paths and success conditions per site

---

## ‚úÖ Phase Deliverables

- Categorized site registry
- `site_registry.json` config file
- At least 10 Selenium-ready template JSONs under `/templates/sites/`
- A toggle in GUI to switch categories and see matched sites
- Auto-template-injection to ReviewBot for 1-click posting

---

This phase unlocks powerful commercial potential by reducing friction for everyday users. It's a massive UX win.
